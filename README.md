# NxM-Multiplier
This project is a Verilog HDL module with specific constraints on two inputs, N and M. The input N must be an integer greater than 2 and less than 15, meaning it ranges from 3 (binary 0011) to 14 (binary 1110). The input M must be the succeeding number of N, thus M = N + 1. The module ensures these constraints are satisfied during operation.
